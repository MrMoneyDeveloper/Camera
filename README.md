**‚ú® .NET MAUI Camera Configuration App**

Project Overview

This .NET MAUI application was developed to allow users to configure up to four cameras with secure storage and encryption. The project followed best practices for Shell navigation, data persistence, and user validation.

**‚úÖ Features Completed**

1. Core Functionality

Camera Configuration Page (CameraSettingsPage.xaml)

Users can configure 1 to 4 cameras.

Input fields for IP Address, RTSP Port, Username, and Password.

Validation ensures proper formatting for IP and port.

Data Persistence

Implemented using AES-256 encryption for security.

Settings are stored securely and persist after app restarts.

Partial configurations allowed (Users don‚Äôt need to fill all 4 camera slots).

Navigation

Shell navigation (AppShell.xaml) to manage page transitions efficiently.

Fixed duplicate route registration issues.

RTSP Streaming (Using LibVLC)

Implemented RTSP stream playback using the LibVLCSharp library.

Dynamic layout for multiple camera views (1, 2, 3, or 4 feeds displayed based on user configuration).

Error handling for stream failures (Invalid credentials, unreachable IP, etc.).

Error Handling & UI Enhancements

Validation messages for incorrect inputs.

Improved user experience with clear labels and form layouts.

**‚ùå Features NOT Completed (and Why)**

1. Advanced RTSP Streaming Features (Not Implemented)

Reason: While basic RTSP streaming is functional using LibVLCSharp, advanced features such as PTZ controls, stream recording, and snapshot capture were not implemented due to time constraints.

2. SQLite Database Storage (Instead of Preferences)

Reason: The app currently uses .NET MAUI Preferences for local storage. A structured SQLite database could improve data handling but was left out to prioritize security (encryption) over complexity.

3. Multi-Platform Support (iOS & Windows)

Reason: The focus was on Android, and additional platform testing/debugging was not completed. The app structure is cross-platform, but minor adjustments would be needed for full support.

4. UI Enhancements & Advanced Features

Live Camera Preview ‚ùå (Implemented RTSP playback, but no preview before saving settings)

PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) Camera Controls ‚ùå (Requires specific camera support & API integration)

QR Code-based Camera Setup ‚ùå (Would require QR scanning & parsing logic)

Cloud Sync Support ‚ùå (Would need Firebase or similar backend integration)

**üìå Summary**

**‚úÖ Successfully Implemented:**

Secure Camera Configuration Page with AES-256 encrypted storage.

Persistent settings that survive app restarts.

Shell navigation with bug fixes.

RTSP streaming using LibVLC with dynamic multi-camera layouts.

User-friendly validation & improved UI experience.

**‚ùå Not Implemented (Due to Time & Scope Constraints):**

Advanced RTSP features (PTZ, recording, snapshots).

Advanced storage using SQLite.

Multi-platform testing (focused on Android).

Additional UI/UX features (QR setup, cloud sync, etc.).

**üîÑ Future Enhancements**

To complete the full vision of this project, future updates can include:

‚úÖ Advanced RTSP Features (Snapshot capture, recording, PTZ controls).

‚úÖ Better Data Management (Migrate from Preferences to SQLite for structured storage).

‚úÖ Multi-Platform Support (iOS & Windows compatibility testing).

‚úÖ Cloud Sync & Backup for camera settings.

**üöÄ Final Thoughts**

This project successfully lays the foundation for a full-featured camera configuration app. RTSP streaming was implemented using LibVLC, but additional enhancements can make it even more powerful. The core settings management, security, and persistence were fully achieved, setting the stage for future improvements.

üîπ Next Steps: Expand RTSP features, refine UI, and enhance storage! üí°
